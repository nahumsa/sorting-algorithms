# Sorting algorithms

This algorithms are based on [algorithms with go](https://algorithmswithgo.com/).

Sorting algorithms implemented: 
    - Bubble Sort: Time complexity of O(N²);
    - Insertion Sort: Time complexity of O(N²);
    - Shell Sort: Time complexity of O(N (log N)²).
    - Merge Sort: Time complexity of O(N log N)
